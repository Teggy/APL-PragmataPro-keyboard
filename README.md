# 87-key APL keyboard (with PragmataPro key caps)

This SVG file defines a 87-key layout which I
have used to order a custom-built mechanical keyboard
from [WASD Keyboards](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/).

- Derived from the official [WASD keyboard layout template](https://support.wasdkeyboards.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009403848-Intro-to-Custom-Layouts).
- 87 keys:

       - **Regular QWERTY layout**.  Key caps use [Fabrizio Schiavi](https://twitter.com/fabrizioschiavi)'s fabulous mono-spaced font [PragmataPro](https://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/).  If you
         like to obtain that font for general use, it is available from [fsd.it](https://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/).

       - **APL symbols**.  Follows the layout of [Dyalog's US keyboard](https://www.dyalog.com/apl-font-keyboard.htm).
         Updated to reflect recent additions to [Dyalog APL](http://dyalog.com), *e.g.*, the `iota underbar` symbol (functions *where*/*interval index*) 
         on the <kbd>I</kbd> key.  The APL symbols use the wide-spread
         [APL 385 font](https://www.dyalog.com/uploads/files/download.php?file=fonts_and_keyboards/Apl385.ttf) (TTF).

- The SVG file has been edited with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) (on macOS).
  The required PragmataPro and APL 385 characters have been traced and their traces are included in the SVG file.
  (Note: I cannot provide the licensed PragmataPro font itself.)

- See [Dyalog's instructions](https://www.dyalog.com/apl-font-keyboard.htm) on how to map the keys of this layout for
  use on your operating system.  Straightforward, really.

Enjoy.
